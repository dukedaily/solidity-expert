# SOLANA EXPERT

This repository is ideal for developers with some experience in Ethereum who want to expand their blockchain skills to Solana.

We will kick off our Solana journey with this tutorial: [RareSkills Solana Tutorial](https://www.rareskills.io/solana-tutorial) and build our projects along the way.

This is the twin sister of my other Solidity tutorial, which has garnered over 1.3K stars: [Solidity Expert](https://github.com/dukedaily/solidity-expert).

Hoping to achieve similar success on Solana as well. So, are you ready? Better buckle up—LFG!
